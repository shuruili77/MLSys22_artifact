# Description of the videos

The first video is resnet_14_1.mp4. In this video, we demonstrated the connection of the microcontroller to the host, adding testbench to the source group, Keil runtime environment configuration and target selection and configuration. We then demonstrated the compilation of the codes and how to actually execute the compiled codes on the connected microcontroller via Keil's debugger. We also showed the built-in timer used to measure the runtime of the codes.

In the second video (resnet_14_2.mp4), we demonstrated how/where to modify the parameters (lookup table size in the demo) to test on different setups. We did the build-execute flow again to measure the runtime of different lookup table sizes.

In the third video (mobilenet_v2.mp4), we demonstrated the runtime evaluation flow for the mobilenet_v2 testbench.
